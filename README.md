# LetterCounter
A simple website designed to calculate the number of instances of each letter in a phrase/sentence.  Can ignore capitalization if checkbox is selected.

## CSS Theme
CSS is straight from bootstrap, using the "cover template" found under the examples on their website. Modified background color and used relative positioning on the header and footer.
